                <h1>Paramount Log Homes, Making the Dream Affordable!</h1>
                <p>If you’re thinking about building a log home, we’re here to help you make that dream a reality.  Paramount Log Homes offers tremendous value, great customer service, flexibility with our floor plans, and years of experience building log homes in the Billings region.

                    If you’ve been in the area for a while, you’ve probably seen some of our homes around, as we’ve built in most of the surrounding
                    communities, including Shepherd, Roundup, Columbus, Red Lodge, Joliet, Roberts, Huntley, Hysham, Glasgow, Winifred, Lockwood and many more.
                    We build with native Ponderosa Pine, and are able to offer prices that meet or beat most of the custom builders in the area, whether log, manufactured, or stick built. </p>
                    
                    <p>Take a look around the website, we have all of our stock plans online, along with our pricing updated for 2022.
                    We have plans for everyone, whether you’re looking for a log cabin kit, a turnkey log home, something for your recreational
                    property on which you want to do some of the work, or anything in between.  We’ve built starter homes for young families, large homes
                    for families escaping the rush of the big city, and mid-sized homes for empty-nesters, along with a variety of cabins for weekend
                    getaways.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Don't see a plan that works for you?  Not a problem.  Send us a sketch of something you have in mind and we'll give
                    you a bid on what it would cost to make that a reality. </P>
                    
                    <p>We continue to search for ways to keep costs down, but only so much we can do while continuing to build a quality home.
                    Please feel free to ask for suggestions on ways to reduce costs (plan modifications and homeowner involvement can often reduce the price by thousands of dollars).
                    Just remember, though, that bank financed projects require a home to be completed in a timely manner (no installing the carpet or interior doors in a couple of years). </p>
                    
                    <p>I'm also including a new page on the website to help serious customers understand the building process and what you can expect as a project progresses, as well as things you can do prior to signing a contract that can help things progress smoothly and with minimal stress. </p>

                <h2>2023 February Update</h2>
                <p>Just finished pricing updates for 2023.  Initially I didn't expect things to be as steep this year as the last two, but after having conversations with HVAC, Plumbing, and the window supplier, and, well, 2023 isn't off to a great start.
                    Factor in labor cost increases, and price increases for this year are, percentage wise, just a little bit less than the previous two.
                    I did add some significant increases to the allowances, as septic prices are higher, cabinets are notably higher, flooring is up, etc.
                    Thankfully lumber is down from a year ago (though up 30% from recent lows), or else prices would be really crazy.  As is, things from a price standpoint are difficult, to say the least.
                    Not sure what it will take outside of a housing collapse for prices to become sane again.</p>
                <p>Schedule is still booked out 15 months.  Unless several customers change their mind there won't be any starts in 2023 for folks who are not already on the books.  The one thing that might impact that is if capable labor becomes available.  Currently I have a good, but small crew.  I've tried to find help, but there is not an abundance of folks looking for work currently.
                    If it were just me having those struggles we could manage, but it's at pretty much all levels, so the trades are backed up, supplies are hard to come by, it's just a difficult time to be building.  The net result for the time being is that projects are slow to complete.
                    Where we used to be able to schedule a trade 3 weeks out and have them on time, now we're attempting to schedule 2 months out, and still not getting them when we're anticipating.
                    On the bright side, truss lead times have dropped from 9 months down to about 5, and windows are around 8 weeks out instead of 13, so things are trending in a positive direction.
                    We'll watch and see if that continues into the warmer months, or if that is just a result of a slower building schedule over the winter.  Keep your fingers crossed. </p>
                <h2>2022 September Update</h2>
                <p>Times continue to be crazy in the building world.  Lumber prices actually seem to be dropping, and may actually sustain at these lower levels, although it seems for every price that drops, 2 or 3 other categories see it as an opportunity to take an increase.
                    Fuel prices are still obviously high for travel, but they also impact timber harvesting and processing, as most of that equipment is powered by diesel, along with the transportation, and so log prices are staying high.
                    Lead times for new projects are maintaining at around 16 months from when the hold fee is paid until we're able to start on a project.
                    I keep anticipating things will slow down and shorten up with the higher interest rates, but so far have not see it. </p>
                <p>The biggest issue we are facing right now is unanticipated delays from sub-contractors and suppliers.
                    In this area there is still an abundance of work and a shortage of skilled trades, so there is a lot of waiting around for work to get done.
                    A concrete contractor I spoke with last week told me that the night previous when he got back in cell range around 9:00 P.M. he had 5 messages on his phone from folks wanting work done.
                    He said 5 was unusually high, but 1 or 2 a day is average, and he can only complete 1-2 jobs a week.
                    It's a similar thing with electricians, plumbers and other trades.  Great time to be in the trades, bad time to be needing work done. </p>
